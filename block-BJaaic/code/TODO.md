```js
function Animal(location, numberOfLegs) {
    this.location = location;
    this.numberOfLegs = numberOfLegs;
}

Animal.prototype = {
    eat: function() {
        console.log(`I live in ${this.location} and I can eat`);
    },
    changeLocation: function(newLocation) {
        this.location = newLocation;
    },
    summary: function() {
